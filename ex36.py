Rules for if-statements
1) Every if must have an else
2) in the case that the else should never run, then use a die function that prints an error 
3) never nest if statements more than 2 deep - try to only use 1 deep
4) treat an if statement like a paragraph - put blank lines after the block 
5) tests should be simple - use good names. 

Rules for Loops: 
1) use a whole only to loop forever
2) use a for loop for all other kinds of looping e.g. a limited number 

Tips for debugging: 
1) don't use a debugger, 
2) print out values to figure out what is wrong 
3) write in small blocks - and test frequently
